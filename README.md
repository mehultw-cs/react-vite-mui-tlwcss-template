  <h1>Vite + React + TailwindCss(JIT) + MaterialUI</h1>
</p>


This template allows you to quickly scaffold a React project with Vitem, React Router, TailwindCss with JIT Compiler and MaterialUI. We use Vite because it's much faster than webpack. We use tailwindcss JIT compiler because it makes tailwindcss build time negligible and offers more features that you can check here [Tailwind JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode). Talking about Vite, you can find more information here [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
